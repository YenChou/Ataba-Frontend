# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Next.js 15.5.3 frontend application called "ataba-frontend" using React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS 4. The project follows the App Router architecture and includes Turbopack for faster development builds.

**IMPORTANT**: This project is for rebuilding the Ataba company website. All development must reference the `TODO.md` file for project roadmap, page structure, and development priorities. The website structure and requirements are strictly defined in TODO.md and should not be modified based on legacy code or other sources.

## Development Commands

- **Start development server**: `npm run dev` (uses Turbopack for faster builds)
- **Build for production**: `npm run build` (uses Turbopack)
- **Start production server**: `npm start`
- **Lint code**: `npm run lint` (ESLint with Next.js config)

## Architecture

### Directory Structure
- `app/` - Next.js App Router directory containing pages and layouts
  - `layout.tsx` - Root layout with Geist fonts and global styles
  - `page.tsx` - Home page component
  - `globals.css` - Global styles with Tailwind CSS and CSS custom properties
- `public/` - Static assets (SVG icons for the default Next.js template)

### Styling System
- **CSS Framework**: Tailwind CSS 4 with `@theme inline` configuration
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Uses CSS variables for theming (`--background`, `--foreground`)
- **Dark Mode**: Automatic dark mode support via `prefers-color-scheme`
- **Fonts**: Geist Sans and Geist Mono loaded via `next/font/google`

### TypeScript Configuration
- **Target**: ES2017
- **Module Resolution**: bundler mode
- **Path Mapping**: `@/*` maps to root directory
- **Strict Mode**: Enabled with strict TypeScript settings

### Linting
- ESLint configuration using Next.js core web vitals and TypeScript rules
- Ignores build output directories (`.next/`, `out/`, `build/`)

## Project Requirements

### Development Workflow

#### üìã Before Starting Any Feature
1. **Always check TODO.md first** before starting any development work
2. **Create a new git branch** when starting a new feature
3. **Follow the exact page structure** defined in TODO.md - do not deviate from specified pages and routes
4. **Reference design guidelines** from https://bestloffice.com/ for professional enterprise styling
5. **All reference documents** must be placed in the `docs/` directory

#### üîÑ Incremental Development Process (CRITICAL)
**IMPORTANT**: When implementing a feature with multiple parts, you MUST follow this step-by-step process:

1. **Break down the task**: If a feature has multiple parts (e.g., Part 1, Part 2, Part 3), list them clearly
2. **Implement ONE part at a time**: Complete only one part before moving to the next
3. **Wait for user confirmation**: After completing each part, STOP and wait for user approval before proceeding
4. **Show progress**: Explain what you completed and what's next
5. **Get explicit approval**: Only proceed to the next part after user says "continue", "next", "proceed", or similar

**Example of correct workflow:**
```
User: Implement About page with 4 parts: Banner, About Us, Video, CTA
Assistant: I'll implement these parts one by one. Starting with Part 1: Banner...
[implements Banner part only]
Assistant: Part 1 (Banner) is complete. Should I proceed to Part 2 (About Us)?
User: Yes, continue
Assistant: Now implementing Part 2 (About Us)...
[implements About Us part only]
Assistant: Part 2 (About Us) is complete. Should I proceed to Part 3 (Video)?
```

**DO NOT**: Implement all parts at once without user confirmation between steps

#### üìù After Completing Tasks
1. **Update TODO.md** when completing tasks or discovering new requirements
2. **Create clear commits** with descriptive messages
3. **Test the build** before committing major changes
